# Triptalk

It's an app that allows you to submit messages and Like them.

## The Task

There are two possible tasks in this exercise. You can choose to do one or both, though we only expect you to tackle one.

The first task is to add functionality to choose the visibility of the message when submitting it. The options are public and private. We then want you to add functionality to filter the feed by different visibility levels.

The second task is to extend this application to show a count of the number of times a message has been Liked.

## How this session is structured

This exercise isn't about fully implementing a feature and so there's no need to worry about finishing it in the time. We're interested in coming along a journey with you and seeing how you approach this sort of work. Imagine you're already part of our team and this is the next big feature we want to get in front of customers.

Assume this application is already in production and that every commit (assuming it passes the tests) will be deployed straight to production - this is the way we do work.

The exercise is based on the tech stack we actually use and the code is representative of some of the apps we have to work in - it's not perfect!

We'll be working as a pair so talk through your thinking and don't hesitate to ask questions or for opinions from your pair.

We'd like you to commit your changes to a local git repository. Treat your commit as though it will push and deploy the app to production.

Feel free to look stuff up on the internet, it's not a memory test. There are no deliberate tricks or gotchas here, at least not intentionally.

We'll take a break halfway for 5-10 mins.

There will be 15 minutes at end for questions.

## Required dependencies

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`
- `node` v20.9.0 (or you can use `nvm` if your platform supports it)
- `yarn`

## Setting up the project

Download the project dependencies and start the database in docker.

```
$ nvm install
$ corepack enable
$ yarn
$ docker compose up -d
```

## Running tests

You need to have the database running in Docker when running the tests.

```
$ yarn test
```

## Starting the project

In two separate terminals/tabs:

```
$ cd server
$ yarn start
```

```
$ cd web
$ yarn start
```

This will start the app locally with automatic refreshing of the web and server components when you make a change.
